    <summary><h2>Modding QOL features</h2></summary>

- New assets and scripting management - **Applies both to the `assets` folder and mods.**
    - Support for `hscript-improved`, a fork made to allow HScript to push modding even further
        - Allows for imports
        - Allows for public variables (variables shared between every script in a ScriptPack such as a song scripts)
        - Allows for static variables (variabels shared between every single script ran in this mod)
        - Allows you to use for example `boyfriend` instead of `PlayState.boyfriend` or `game.boyfriend`, for smaller and easier to comprehend code.
        - Allows you to use `@:bypassAccessor`
        - Allows you to use maps
    - Usage of XML files for Characters instead of hardcoding them.
        - Animation names, prefixes, indices, etc... can be set in the XML without an additional line of code.
        - Offsets are automatically fixed. That means changes such as scaling, rotation, and playing as an opponent character wont break them.
    - Entirely new song structure (`songs/name/`)
        - Usage of `meta.json`, which allows you to synchronize data between charts and the Freeplay menu.
            - Charts can use their own by specifying `meta` in the JSON (Codename charts only)
        - Charts are now located in `songs/name/charts/`, and are named after the difficulty `hard.json` instead of `name-hard.json`
            - Difficulties are auto-detected in case they aren't specified in the `meta.json` file.
        - Scripts are located in `songs/name/scripts/`, and only applies to the current song.
            - Script that applies on every song are located in `data/charts/`.
        - Song files are now located in `songs/name/song/`. They still follow their `Inst.ogg` and `Voices.ogg` names.
            - Inst/Voices for custom difficulties can be set by naming those files `Inst-difficulty.ogg` and/or `Voices-difficulty.ogg`.
            - Song length limits
    - Usage of XML files for stages. XMLs can:
        - Change camera zooms, camera offsets, etc...
        - Add elements to the stage and

            - Moving the `<boyfriend />`, `<girlfriend />` and `<dad />` nodes will move them in the layers
            - Adding x and y attributes to them will change their position
            - You can add positioning for custom characters by adding `<character name="name" />`
    - Usage of XML files for weeks.
        - Characters are located in `data/weeks/characters`.
